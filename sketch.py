"""
Schotter — after Georg Nees, 1968.

A square grid that falls apart as it descends. The top row is perfectly ordered;
each row after it is rotated and displaced a little more than the one before.
Nees plotted the original on a Zuse Graphomat; you are about to do it in a
language he did not have, on a machine he would have envied.

Run it:

    python sketch.py

It writes sketch.svg next to this file. Open that in a browser (or drag it into
VS Code). Nothing to install — this uses only what ships with Python.

Then change one of the numbers below, run it again, and commit. GitHub will show
you the two images side by side.
